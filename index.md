## Education Data Science in Action

The field of education data science offers opportunities for innovation in research and practice. The availability of new methods and data sources, catalyzed in an age of digital learning, has brought a variety of experts and novices together in multi-disciplined work. For some, education data science is the application of an existing domain of expertise to answering new questions. But as the popularity of the field expands, increasingly people begin at the intersection and navigate the growing body of work to find their avenue of contribution.

What does it mean to do data science in education? For each of the many different applications, led by practitioners of diverse backgrounds and skillsets, the answer varies greatly. This site is a repository of case studies aimed to illustrate the complexity and promise of the field through concrete examples of the work in action.
